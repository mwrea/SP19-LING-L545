    \n The first major difference between the two taggers is the amount of time required.
    The Perceptron-based tagger completed extremely quickly in comparison with UDPipe,
    which took around 10 minutes to finish. UDPipe also had more complex commands,
    while the Perceptron tagger was 2 simple lines. As for the output, the UPOS
    results had a higher degree of precision than Perceptron, but Perceptron's Lemmas,
    XPOS, and features were all rated at 100% precision and F1 score by conll17_us_eval.py
