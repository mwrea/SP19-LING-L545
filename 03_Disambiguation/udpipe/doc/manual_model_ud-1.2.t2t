Universal Dependencies 1.2 Models are versioned according to the date released
in the format ``YYMMDD``, where ``YY``, ``MM`` and ``DD`` are two-digit
representation of year, month and day, respectively. The latest version is 160523.

The models were trained on [Universal Dependencies 1.2 http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1548] treebanks.

For the UD treebanks which do not contain original plain text version,
raw text is used to train the tokenizer instead. The plain texts
were taken from the [W2C -- Web to Corpus http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-097C-0000-0022-6133-9].

=== Model Description ===[universal_dependencies_12_models_description]

The Universal Dependencies 1.2 models contain 36 models, each consisting of
a tokenizer, tagger, lemmatizer and dependency parser, all trained using
the UD data. The model for Japanese is missing, because we do not have
the license for the required corpus of Mainichi Shinbun 1995.

The tokenizer is trained using the ``SpaceAfter=No`` features. If the features
are not present in the data, they can be filled in using raw text in the
language in question (surprisingly, quite little data suffices, we use 500kB).

The tagger, lemmatizer and parser are trained using gold UD data.

Details about model architecture and training process can be found in the
(Straka et al. 2016) paper.

=== Model Performance ===[universal_dependencies_12_models_performance]

We present the tagger, lemmatizer and parser performance, measured
on the testing portion of the data. Only the segmentation and the
tokenization of the testing data is retained before evaluation.
Therefore, the dependency parser is evaluated without gold POS tags.
